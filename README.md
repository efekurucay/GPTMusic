# GPTMusic MIDI Composition Project

This project aims to simplify the process of composing music by generating MIDI files using Python. The project includes MIDI files representing various music layers (tracks) and the Python scripts used to create them. Each MIDI file corresponds to a single instrument or music layer, such as rhythm, bass, harmony, or melody.

## About the Project

This project was developed with **guidance and support from GPT**. During the process:
- Chord progressions, melodies, and other music layers were suggested and created by GPT.
- The project serves as a foundation for understanding the basics of AI-driven music composition and offers a manual approach to managing music creation.

The project also explores the inner workings of AI music systems, focusing on the fundamental building blocks of music: **notes**, **tracks**, and **patterns**.

## Project Structure

### Folders:
- **`mid files`**:
  Contains the generated MIDI files. Each file represents a different instrument or music layer.

- **`create mid w py`**:
  Contains Python scripts that demonstrate how the MIDI files were generated.

### General Structure:
- Rhythm Layer (Drums)
- Bassline Layer (Bassline)
- Harmony Layer (Chords)
- Melody Layer (Lead Melody)
- Strings Layer (Strings)
- Dynamic Layers (Arpeggio or additional effects)

The number of tracks and content can grow as the project evolves.

## Why This Project?

This project was designed to understand how AI music generators (e.g., OpenAI Jukebox, Google Magenta) work and to build a basic system for music composition.

In this project:
- **Tracks (Layers):** Music is divided into different layers, such as drums, bass, and melody.
- **MIDI Format:** Files are generated in MIDI format, with each track representing a specific instrument.
- **Chords and Melodies:** Chord progressions (Am ‚Üí F ‚Üí C ‚Üí G) and melody ideas were suggested by GPT.

## How to Use

1. **Generate MIDI Files with Python**:
   - Use the Python scripts in the `create mid w py` folder to generate the MIDI files.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python track1.py
     ```

2. **Load MIDI Files into a DAW**:
   - Import the MIDI files from the `mid files` folder into a DAW (e.g., FL Studio).
   - Assign instruments and effects as needed in your DAW.

3. **Edit and Enhance**:
   - Use your DAW software to modify the MIDI files, add new layers, or refine existing ones.

## System Requirements

### Software:
- **Python** (for generating MIDI files)
- **DAW** (for editing and playing MIDI files)
  - Suggestions: FL Studio, Ableton Live, Reaper

### Python Modules:
- **`mido`**:
  Required module for creating MIDI files.
  Installation:
  ```bash
  pip install mido
